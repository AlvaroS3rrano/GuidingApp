npx expo run:android --device

You will need to update your server’s IP address in two places:

1. Start ngrok:
   - In a terminal, run:
     ngrok http https://localhost:8443 --host-header="localhost:8443"
   - Look for the “Forwarding” line, for example:
     https://abcd1234.ngrok-free.app -> https://localhost:8443

2. Copy the ngrok host into your constant:
   - From the forwarding URL, take the part between “https://” and “/”, e.g.
     abcd1234.ngrok-free.app
   - In app/constants/consts.ts set:
     export const COMP_IP = 'abcd1234.ngrok-free.app';
